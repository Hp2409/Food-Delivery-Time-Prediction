# ML Project – Food Delivery Time Prediction

This repository was autogenerated from provided Jupyter notebooks and arranged
into a modular, GitHub-friendly structure.  
The project focuses on predicting **food delivery times** using real-world data
from [Kaggle’s Food Delivery Time Prediction Case Study](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhanupratapbiswas/food-delivery-time-prediction-case-study).

## Background & Theory

Food delivery services are a critical part of modern lifestyles. Customers
expect timely and accurate delivery estimates, but predicting delivery times is
complex due to factors such as:

- **Restaurant preparation time**  
- **Traffic and weather conditions**  
- **Rider speed and efficiency**  
- **Order type and distance**

Traditional rule-based methods often fail to capture the complexity of these
factors. Machine Learning provides a **data-driven approach** that can adapt to
real-world variability and improve prediction accuracy.

### Dataset
We use the Kaggle dataset *“Food Delivery Time Prediction Case Study”*.  
It contains information about delivery duration along with features such as:

- Restaurant and customer locations (latitude, longitude)  
- Type of vehicle used for delivery  
- Weather and traffic details  
- Rider-specific attributes  

### Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values, remove outliers.  
   - Encode categorical features (e.g., vehicle type).  
   - Feature engineering: compute distance using `geopy` (Haversine formula).  

2. **Model Training**  
   - Algorithms tested: Linear Regression, Lasso, Decision Tree, Random Forest.  
   - Evaluation metrics: MAE, RMSE, R².  
   - Random Forest performed best, capturing complex non-linear relationships.  

3. **Deployment**  
   - Final model saved with `joblib`.  
   - Demo script allows predictions on new CSV files or manual input.  

### Key Findings
- Distance, traffic, and weather strongly influence delivery times.  
- Tree-based models (Decision Tree, Random Forest) outperform linear models.  
- Proper preprocessing significantly improves accuracy.  

This project demonstrates that **data-driven ML models can provide more reliable
delivery time estimates** than traditional heuristics, improving customer
satisfaction and operational efficiency.

## Setup
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux / macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##  Training
```bash
python train.py --data_file train.csv --target target_col --model_out models/model.joblib
```

##  Demo / Inference
```bash
python demo.py --model models/model.joblib --data_file test.csv --output results/preds.csv
```

Quick demo with manual input:
```bash
python demo.py --model models/model.joblib --sample "1.0,2.0,3.5"
```

##  Notes
- Default model is a `RandomForestRegressor`.
- You can replace it with your preferred algorithm.
- The preprocessing pipeline is generic — adapt it to your dataset if needed.
